# Hide and Show Password Project

This project demonstrates a **password visibility toggle** feature using **JavaScript**. It allows users to hide or show their password while typing in a form. The key features include:

- **Password Validation**: Ensures password meets certain criteria (e.g., length, characters).
- **Toggle Visibility**: Users can toggle between hiding and showing their password with a simple button click.
- **Responsive Design**: The form adjusts for different screen sizes using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Secure Input**: The password remains secure while switching between visibility states.
