# Form Validation Project

This project demonstrates a simple **form validation** system using **JavaScript**. The form takes in a username and password and validates both fields before submission. It checks for:

- Username: Must be alphanumeric and between 3-15 characters.
- Password: Must contain at least one number, one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and be between 6-20 characters.

## Features:
- Client-side validation using vanilla JavaScript.
- Custom error messages displayed for invalid inputs.
- Responsive form design using HTML and CSS.
